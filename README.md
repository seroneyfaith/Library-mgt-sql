# Library-mgt-sql
In this project, I explore library data from six tables belonging to a library:
1. Books table - lists the books available in the library
2. Branch table - lists the different library branches
3. Employees table - lists library employees
4. Members table - lists library members
5. Issued status table - lists the books that have been issued and their issued dates
6. Return status table - lists the books that have been returned and those not returned

After importing the data, I analyze it comprehensively using t-sql. There are two parts of the code. The first is beginner and intermediate friendly while the latter
is more advanced. If you're here, I hope you learn someting from the code or suffer the conSQLses :) (on a lighter note)
